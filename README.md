# Digital Lock ProjectðŸ”’

This repository contains an implementation of a **Digital Lock** using VHDL.

## Overview

The project demonstrates a secure digital locking system designed using the VHDL hardware description language. It is intended for educational purposes and showcases core digital logic concepts.

## Features

- Complete digital lock logic in VHDL
- Ready for FPGA simulation and synthesis
- Modular and easy to understand

## Main Code

You can view the main VHDL source file here:  
[Main code of Digital lock project .vhd](https://github.com/BasantSaad/Digital-lock-/blob/main/Main%20code%20of%20Digital%20lock%20project%20.vhd)

## Documentation

For full details, circuit diagrams, and usage instructions, please refer to the documentation PDF:  
**[Project Digital Lock FPGA.pdf](https://github.com/BasantSaad/Digital-lock-/blob/de16a585ad5b611f53caba08de6800fe5b256ca7/Project%20Digital%20Lock%20FPGA.pdf)**

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BasantSaad/Digital-lock-.git
    ```
2. Open the `.vhd` file in your VHDL editor or simulator.
3. Follow the instructions in the PDF to simulate and test the digital lock.

## Requirements

- VHDL simulation tool (ModelSim, Vivado, Quartus, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of digital logic design
